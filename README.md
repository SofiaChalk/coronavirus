# Coronavirus Dashboard

This dashboard is my first attempt to use dash-plotly to create a visualisation tool for the COVID-19 pandemic.
You can get information regarding the spread of the virus globally as a total, by continent or by location.

Data used: [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

The dashboard is deployed on Heroku and can be found [here](https://sc-covid19-dash.herokuapp.com/)

Still under constraction.
